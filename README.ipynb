    "- Data Scaper Notebook\n",
    "- Data Wrangling Notebook\n",
    "- Data Exploration Notebbook\n",
    "- Data Modeling Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Skills:**\n",
    "- Data capture with BeautifulSoup and Request\n",
    "- Data wrangling using Pandas\n",
    "- Data visualization using Ploty, Seaborn and Matplotlib\n",
    "- Descriptive statistics\n",
    "- Machine Learning using scikit-learn\n",
    "    - Features selection with eli5\n",
    "    - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Lasso, Elastic Net, K-Neighbors Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Support Vector Regression, AdaBoost Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, RandomForestRegressor, ExtraTreesRegressor, XGBRegressor."

    "- download the sitemap.xml\n",
    "- visit each page in sitempa.xml file\n",
    "- collect data of each page, but some pages will be ignored (some conditionals if are specified)\n",

    "The Web Scraper was constructed, in its main core, with BeautifulSoup, Requests and Pandas. The BeautifulSoup turned easy to collect the data from every page. The Requests library made the connection possible to get the data. And Pandas was used to save the data collected into a sigle dataframe."
